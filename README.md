# Halloween2022
This is a project that I developed for W3Schools.com Halloween Event October Competition
This project is a website build of html, css and javascript. 
The website is of a fictional company The HalloweenCon that organizes contest every year on the eve of Halloween. And also deals in merchandise related to Halloween event. 
The contest is all about dressing up scary and horrifying and registering yourself on the website and uploading the selfie of yours. 
Three winners will be chosen. The first will be awarded the $1000 price, the second the $500 price, and the third the $100 price. 
The website also consists of a store that provides categories of merchandise in which the organization deals. 
So this is my first project ever for W3Schools.com. 
Since I am a newbie in front end web development who has completed the html tutorials and currently learning css tutorials from w3schools.com I think this project is the best that I can create right now. 
I would like to thanks W3Schools.com, its discord members for help, motivation and the W3Schools event that started this project. 
I have used Images from Google. And Fonts from "https://www.dafont.com/halloween-too.font" and "https://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=803&text=%26".
